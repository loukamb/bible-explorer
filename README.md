# Bible Explorer

Bible study tools written in React, mainly for personal use. Currently not adapted for mobile devices.

[You can access it here.](https://bible-explorer.louka.sh)

## Features

- Distraction-less interface
- Tabbed browsing for individual chapters
- Toggleable sidebar listing the scriptures
- Search engine for verse contents
- Adjustable zoom level (separate from browser zoom)
- Current workspace state saves in URL (for saving)

**Currently included scripture:** Old Testament & New Testament (NKJV), Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price. Scripture is added regardless of theological validity or sectarian opinion, as this tool is not specifically geared towards any particular Christian denomination.

### Planned

- Additional Bible translations (e.g. ESV)
- Saveable chapters and verses with `LocalStorage`
- Broader search engine for full-Bible searches
- Scriptures from other Christian sects (e.g. Book of Common Prayer, etc.)
- Dictionary for verse interpretation

## Other tools

A more simple application for casual Bible reading can be accessed [here](https://bible.louka.sh) as well, which I recommend over the Bible Explorer if you are linking to a chapter/verse or if you are reading on mobile.

## Licensing

This work has been released into the public domain. The rights to the NKJV translation are owned by [Thomas Nelson Bibles](https://www.thomasnelsonbibles.com/nkjv-bible/).
