Scripture is added regardless of theological validity or sectarian opinion, as this tool is not specifically geared towards any particular Christian denomination.

## Other tools

A more simple application for casual Bible reading can be accessed [here](https://bible.louka.sh) as well, which I recommend over the Bible Explorer if you are linking to a chapter/verse or if you are reading on mobile.
